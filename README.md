8/1/2020: I will be providing only SBAF compensated measurements for now using the MiniDSP EARS. One step at a time.


## File Naming Conventions

The file naming conventions will be as follows:<br><br>
<em>Raw/Comp|Coupler|CompensationVersion|-|Manufacturer|Headphone|Channel.txt</em><br>

Here are some examples:<br><br>
cEAR31-DanClarkAudio-EtherFlow-L.txt<br>
cEAR31-Sennheiser-HD650-R.txt            
cFPC02-Grado-SR225-L.txt         

## File Format

The file will have two columns, frequency Response and amplitude, separated by a tab character. There will be no headers. The columns will look like this:<br>

20.00   -43.43<br>
30.00   -42.32<br>
50.00   -21.33<br>


## Notes about SBAF compensation using a MiniDSP EARS

This compensation is an attempt to have a straight line across as perceptive neutral. Read about it here:

The SBAF curve should be not confused with the Harmon curve from Olive and Welti. The Harmon curve is a consumer preference target.

Here is a spreadsheet for anyone with a MiniDSP EARS to calibrate it to the SBAF compensation. 
Note that all EARS units are slightly different. The spreadsheet contains a delta from my unit's provided HEQ.
In theory, applying this delta to your HEQ files should end with the same results here.

The 3.1 version with the removal of the screws is currently used as of 8/1/2020
